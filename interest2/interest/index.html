						<h3>Have You Eaten?</h3>
						<p>
							China is the home of 1.4 billion foodies. That might seem like hyperbole, but in the world’s most populous country, food culture is simply just culture. The art of cultivating, cooking and eating food is profoundly interwoven with what it means to be Chinese, whether you’re a farmer, factory worker or tech billionaire. In the capital Beijing, the phrase chī le ma? (have you eaten?) is how friends and neighbours greet one another. Food is business, pleasure, health and happiness. Food is life. It&rsquo;s the glue that binds all Chinese people together, no matter their background, social circle or bank balance.
						</p>
						<h3>Chinese Food Culture & The Eight Cuisines</h3>
						<p>
							There are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad. Chinese cuisine is highly diverse and most frequently categorized into provincial divisions, although these province&ndash;level classifications consist of many more styles within themselves. The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang, representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively. The modern Eight Cuisines of China are Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang cuisines.

					<h5>SU (JIANGSU) CUISINE 苏菜</h5>
					<p>
						Su cuisine seeks to highlight the flavor of the original ingredients. The flavors are very subtle, yet tantalizing, bursting with umami. But when it comes to braised dishes, generous use of vinegar, sugar, and rice wine really sets this cuisine apart. You will also find wide uses of Zhenjiang vinegar from the region.

					<h5>CHUAN (SICHUAN) CUISINE 川菜</h5>
					<p>
						Chuan Cuisine, from Sichuan Province, is heavy on oil, salt, and spices&ndash;particularly spicy chilies and numbing Sichuan peppercorns. Its taste is unapologetically in&ndash;your&ndash;face and can&rsquo;t be ignored. Some dishes will cause profuse sweating after just a couple of bites, but you still can’t stop eating.

					<h5>ZHE (ZHEJIANG) CUISINE 浙菜</h5>
					<p>
						Zhejiang is a coastal province with many rivers. In Chinese, it&rsquo;s often called the land of fish and rice&ndash;or the land of plenty. The cuisine utilizes a vast selection of fish and shellfish from both the ocean and its many freshwater rivers.

					<h5>HUI (ANHUI) CUISINE 徽菜</h5>
					<p>
						Hui Cuisine originated in the relatively small, landlocked province of Anhui, located on the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers. It features braises and stews and fewer stir&ndash;fries than other regional cuisines. Wild herbs, mushrooms, and vegetables, game, tofu, and ham all feature prominently.

					<h5>LU (SHANDONG) CUISINE 鲁菜</h5>
					<p>
						With the longest history, Lu Cuisine is ranked #1 of the eight cuisines. It originated in Shandong Province &ndash; a coastal province, so many dishes employ seafood like squid, shrimp, and sea cucumber. Lu cuisine was also known for its complexity, difficulty, and stringent adherence to freshness and quality of ingredients.

					<h5>MIN (FUJIAN) CUISINE 闽菜</h5>
					<p>
						Min Cuisine is from the southeastern coastal province of Fujian. It features the best that both land and sea have to offer. Like most of the cuisines on this list, there are several sub&ndash;styles.

					<h5>XIANG (HUNAN) CUISINE 湘菜</h5>
					<p>Like Sichuan cuisine, Xiang Cuisine (AKA Hunan cuisine) is heavy on the oil, salt, spicy chilies, and garlic. If you like spicy food, but can do without the numbing Sichuan peppercorns, Hunan cuisine should be your top choice. People describe the flavor as &ldquo;dry spicy,&rdquo; or purely spicy. </p>

					<h5>YUE (CANTONESE) CUISINE 粤菜</h5>
					<p>
						While Chuan cuisine may be popular, Yue Cuisine is without a doubt the most popular Chinese cooking style outside of China. Yue Cuisine is more commonly known as Cantonese food, and it hails from the region around the Pearl River Delta, including Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, and Macau.
